 * Base type for tasks which need to be able to limit how many instances run
 * concurrently, like CompactTask.
 *
 * A cb::AwaitableSemaphore limits how many instances may run. Tasks must
 * acquire a token before running. If none are available, the task will snooze
 * forever. When tokens become available, the task will be notified to run
 * again.
 *
 * This is not currently transparent to the task - it is required that the
 * task call:
 *
 * bool runInner() override {
 *     auto guard = acquireOrWait();
 *     if (!guard) {
 *         // could not acquire a token, queued for notification.
 *         // already snooze()-ed forever, just return true to
 *         // reschedule.
 *         return true;
 *     }
 *     // Do concurrency-limited work
 * }
 *
 * However, a future refactor could avoid this by, for example,
 * restructuring as a mixin or re-implementing at the thread pool level.
