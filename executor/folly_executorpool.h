/**
 * ExecutorPool implemented using folly Executors.
 *
 * Initial implementation matches the CB3 Executor pool, which is not
 * idiomatic to Folly but gives a starting point to evolve / simplify later:
 *
 * 1. 4 pools of CancellableCpuExecutor are used for each of the
 *    Reader/Writer/AuxIO/NonIO thread pools. This wraps a
 *    folly::CPUThreadPoolExecutor with a custom queue that we use to allow us
 *    to remove pending work for a given Taskable if that Taskable is going
 *    away.
 *    This can likely be simplified - for example combining the IO pools into
 *    a single pool, then using priorities to ensure correct priorization.
 *
 * 2. A folly::IOThreadPoolExecutor is used to track all GlobalTasks scheduled
 *    for future execution.
 *    This acts as a combined futureQ for all task types. This is split
 *    in 4 queues in CB3Executor, which all threads drain from, however I
 *    anticipate this won't be a problem for FollyExecutorPool given all
 *    actual task execution is flipped over to the CPUThreadPoolExecutors.
 *    When a FollyTask becomes ready, execution is transferred to the relevant
 *    CPUThreadPool to actually run the task.
 *
 * 3. Given CB3ExecutorPool owns its tasks (via shared_ptr<GlobalTask), we
 *    need to do the same here.
 *
 * 4. The primary methods to ExecutorPool are:
 *
 *    a) scheduleule(ExTask) - Register a task, to be run at it's wakeTime.
 *    b) cancel(ExTask) - Cancel a task so it should no longer run.
 *    c) wake(ExTask) - Change a task's current schedule, to be executed asap.
 *    d) snooze(ExTask) - Change a task's current to be executed at the
 *                        specified time.
 *
 *    The main challenge with these methods is there is potential for raciness
 *    with cancel, wake and snooze; given the task may already be running on
 *    a background thread when they are called.
 *    We must ensure that wake-ups are not lost, nor should tasks be run
 *    more once concurrently (say on different threads of the same pool).
 *
 *    Currently these issues are avoided by ensuring that _all_ scheduling
 *    changes (wakeup / snooze / cancel) are performed on the single IO thread
 *    via it's eventBase. This enforces a sequential order on any scheduling
 *    change - it is not possible to also be attempting to change the schedule
 *    on a different thread. We use the
 *    runImmediatelyOrRunInEventBaseThreadAndWait function of the eventBase to
 *    achieve this by running all tasks on the IO thread. The IO thread is
 *    allowed to call back into one of these ExecutorPool functions itself
 *    and the function will run immediately as the eventBase identifies that
 *    the calling thread is the IO thread.
 *    This differs to the approach taken by CB3ExecutorPool, where cancel /
 *    wake / snooze execute on the thread calling them, with judicious use of
 *    mutexes to ensure correctness.
 *
 *    In practical terms, this means that to perform a wake() -> run() ->
 *    snooze() sequence with FollyExecutorPool the following work occurs:
 *
 *      [B] : Blocking call
 *
 *      Calling Thread          IO Thread            CPU Thread Pool
 *
 *      1. [B] wake()
 *         <<enqueue on IO thread>>  -----\
 *         wake() done.                   |
 *                                        V
                                2. Update timeout
 *                                 CPUPool::enqueue()
 *
 *      ... When next CPU thread available ...
 *                                                   3. CPUPool::dequeue()
 *                                                   [B] GlobalTask::execute()
 *                                                   ... perform work ...
 *                                         /-------- Reschedule task <<enqueue
on IO thread>>
*                                          |         ... done..
 *                                         V
 *                              4. rescheduleTaskAfterRun
 *                                 Update timeout
 *
 *    This results in zero context switches for wake() from the caller's POV,
 *    but overall 1 - the IO thread will be woken and need to run at some point
 *    after to actually update the timeout.
 *    It requires two context switches to actually run (and re-schedule) the
 *    task - one to the CPU thread pool, then back to the IO thread to adjust
 *    the next wake time.
 *
 *    CB3ExecutorPool however performs the wake() and snooze() on the calling
 *    thread (but with added mutexes), so in theory it has _zero_ context-
 *    switches. However that is only the case if all mutexes are uncontended -
 *    if there is contention then threads will have to yield and wait to acquire
 *    the mutex - which could result in >4 context switches...
 *
 *    Compared to the CB3ExecutorPool, this approach has:
 *
 *    Pros
 *    + Simpler to reason about / get correct.
 *    + Reduces amount of locking needed, so should allow actual execution
 *      to scale better with more threads (CPU threads shouldn't have to
 *      block much).
 *
 *    Cons:
 *    - More context switches in the best case.
 *    - Single-threaded, potentially limiting scheduling throughput on highly
 *      threaded / high load environments.
 *
 *    Note that Folly claims that an IO thread handle millions of events per
 *    second [1], so for an initial implementation this  seems a reasonable
 *    design - if the single IO thread / context switches are a bottleneck we
 *    can revisit down the line.
