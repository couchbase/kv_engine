# The script is to be used on conjuction with the ep - engine module test
# STHashTableEvictionItemPagerTest.The test is run as follows:

# cd to kv_engine build directory
# run the test as follows, redirecting standard error to a file.For example
# ./ ep - engine_ep_unit_tests -- gtest_filter = STHashTableEvictionTest \
#        .#STHashTableEvictionItemPagerTest 2> eviction_data.txt
# The eviction_data.txt contains a textual output for which documents remain
# resident and which are evicted.

# The script is run as follows, using the example input file eviction_data.txt
# evictionVisualiser.py < eviction_data.txt

# The output from running the script is the generation of a png file
