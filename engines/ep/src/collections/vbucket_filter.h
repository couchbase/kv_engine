/**
 * The VB filter object constructs from data that is yielded from DCP stream
 * request, an optional string. The string is optional because a legacy DCP
 * user will not set any string data, whilst a collection aware request can.
 * However the collection aware request may contain an empty string. For
 * reference here's what the optiona string means.
 *
 * - uninitialized: legacy stream-request. A client that can only ever receive
 *                  the default collection.
 * - empty string: A collection aware client that wants *everything* from the
 *                 epoch. For example KV replication streams.
 * - non-empty string: A collection aware client wanting to resume a stream or
 *                     request specific collections (or both). The non-empty
 *                     string is a JSON document as follows.
 *
 * A client can request individual collections or a group by defining an array
 * of collection-IDs.
 *
 * Client wants two collections:
 *   {"collections":["0", "ac1"]}}
 *
 * Client wants to resume a stream that was previously everything, client
 * specifies the highest manifest UID they've received.
 *   {"uid":"5"}
 *
 * Why not both? Client wants to resume a subset of collections.
 *    {"collections":["0", "ac1"]}, "uid":"5"}
 *
 * The class exposes methods which are for use by the ActiveStream.
 *
 * Should a Mutation/Deletion/SystemEvent be included in the DCP stream?
 *   - checkAndUpdate
 * checkAndUpdate is non-const because for SystemEvents which represent the
 * drop of a collection, they will modify the Filter to remove the collection
 * if the filter was targeting the collection.
