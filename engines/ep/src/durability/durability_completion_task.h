 * This task is used to complete (commit or abort) all SyncWrites which have
 * been resolved by each vbucket's ActiveDM.
 *
 * This is done in a separate task to reduce the amount of work done on
 * the thread which actually detected the SyncWrite was resolved - typically
 * the front-end DCP threads when a DCP_SEQNO_ACK is processed.
 * Given that we SEQNO_ACK at the end of Snapshot, A single SEQNO_ACK could
 * result in committing multiple SyncWrites, and Committing one SyncWrite is
 * similar to a normal front-end Set operation, we want to move this to a
 * background task.
 *
 * Additionally, by doing this in a background task it simplifies lock
 * management, for example we avoid lock inversions with earlier locks acquired
 * during dcpSeqnoAck when attemping to later call notifySeqnoAvailable when
 * this was done on the original thread.
