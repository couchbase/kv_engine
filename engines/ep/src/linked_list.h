/**
 * This class implements SequenceList as a basic doubly linked list.
 * Uses boost intrusive list for doubly linked list implementation.
 *
 * Intrusive hook is to be added to OrderedStoredValue for it to be used in the
 * BasicLinkedList. Once in the BasicLinkedList, OrderedStoredValue is now
 * shared between HashTable and BasicLinkedList.
 *
 * BasicLinkedList sees only the hook for next and prev; HashTable
 * see only the hook for hashtable chaining.
 *
 * But there should be an agreement on the deletion (invalidation of next and
 * prev link; chaining link) of the elements between these 2 class objects.
 * Currently,
 * (i) HashTable owns a OrderedStoredValue (as a unique_ptr) that is not stale.
 * (ii) It relinquishes the ownership by marking it stale. This happens when
 *      deduplication is not possible and we want to keep an old value around.
 * (iii) BasicLinkedList deletes the stale OrderedStoredValues.
 * (iv) During a Hashtable clear (full or partial), which happens during
 *      VBucket delete or rollback, we first remove the element from
 *      BasicLinkedList (invalidate next, prev links) and then delete from the
 *      hashtable.
 *
 * Ordering/Hierarchy of Locks:
 * ===========================
 * BasicLinkedList has 3 locks namely:
 * (i) writeLock (ii) rangeLock (iii) rangeReadLock
 * Description of each lock can be found below in the class declaration, here
 * we describe in what order the locks should be grabbed
 *
 * rangeReadLock ==> writeLock ==> rangeLock is the valid lock hierarchy.
 *
 * Preferred/Expected Lock Duration:
 * ================================
 * 'writeLock' and 'rangeLock' are held for short durations, typically for
 * single list element writes and reads.
 * 'rangeReadLock' is held for longer duration on the list (for entire range).
