 * SequenceList is the abstract base class for the classes that hold ordered

 * classes around basic data structures like Linkedlist or Skiplist.
 *
 * 'OrderedStoredValue' is the in-memory representation of an item that can be
 * stored sequentially and SequenceList derivatives store a sequence of
 * 'OrderedStoredValues'. Based on the implementation of SequenceList,
 * OrderedStoredValue might have to carry an intrusive component that
 * is necessary for the list.

 * SequenceList expects the module that contains it, takes the responsibility
 * of serializing the OrderedStoredValue. SequenceList only guarantees to hold
 * the OrderedStoredValue in the order they are sent to it. For this it forces
 * the write calls to pass the seq lock held by them
 *
 * Note: These classes only handle the position of the 'OrderedStoredValue' in
 *       the ordered sequence desired. They do not update a OrderedStoredValue.

     * for the abstract base class that defines the APIs for range iteration on
     * the derived concrete classes of the SequenceList. It calls the range
     * iterators of the concrete classes polymorphically at runtime. However
     * clients get this statically typed "RangeIterator" object when they
     * request for an iterator for a SequenceList object.
     *
     * Usage:
     * 1. Create an iterator instance using SequenceList::makeRangeIterator()
     * 2. Iterate (read) through all the list elements.
     * 3. Delete the iterator.
     * Note: (a) Do not hold the iterator for long, as it will result in stale
     *           items in list and hence increased memory usage.
     *       (b) Make sure to delete the iterator after using it.
     *       (c) For now, we allow on one RangeIterator. Try to create more
     *           iterators will result in the create call(s) being blocked.
