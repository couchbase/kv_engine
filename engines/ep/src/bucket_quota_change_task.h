/**
 * The purpose of the BucketQuotaChangeTask is to change the Bucket quota
 * gracefully such that we avoid QoS issues due to TMP_FAIL of new mutations
 * when we decrease the Bucket quota. This task deals with Bucket quota
 * increases too to avoid attempted concurrent changes in Bucket quota in either
 * direction.
 *
 * To deal with Bucket quota increases, the tasks needs to only increase the
 * Bucket quota and all associated values. We do not need to wait for memory
 * recovery. To deal with Bucket quota reductions the task operates in 2 phases:
 *
 * Phase 1:
 *
 * Set the new watermark values to reduce memory usage without causing out of
 * memory errors.
 *
 * 1) Set the storage quota to the new value (to kick off any background memory
 *    reclamation)
 * 2) Set the checkpoint manager watermarks to some temporary values so that
 *    checkpoint memory recovery kicks in (if necessary) without reducing the
 *    CMQuota. That way we kind of 'anticipate' checkpoint mem-recovery and
 *    incoming mutations are not any more likely to be blocked by the new
 *    CMQuota once it is set.
 * 3) Decrease our memory determined backfill limit
 * 4) Set the low and high watermark values
 * 5) Wake the ItemPager/ExpiryPager to recover memory from the HashTable
 *
 * We perform steps 1-4 in this particular order to avoid over-reclaiming memory
 * from the HashTables if possible. After completing Phase 1, the task moves
 * immediately to Phase 2 (i.e. if memory is already low enough to support the
 * new quota then the new quota is applied immediately).
 *
 * Phase 2:
 *
 * Wait for memory usage to be within acceptable limits for the new quota,
 * then enforece the new quota.
 *
 * 6) Wait until memory is below the high watermark
 * 7) Enforce the new quota by changing the config and stats values
 *
