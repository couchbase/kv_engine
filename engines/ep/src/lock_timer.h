/**
 * Lock holder wrapper to assist to debugging locking issues - Logs when the
 * time taken to acquire a lock, or the duration a lock is held exceeds the
 * specified thresholds.
 *
 * Implemented as a template class around a RAII-style lock holder:
 *
 *   T - underlying lock holder type (LockHolder, ReaderLockHolder etc).
 *   ACQUIRE_MS - Report instances when it takes longer than this to acquire a
 *                lock.
 *   HELD_MS - Report instance when a lock is held (locked) for longer than
 *             this.
 *
 * Usage:
 * To debug a single lock holder - wrap the class with a LockTimer<>, adding
 * a lock name as an additional argument - e.g.
 *
 *   std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lh(mutex)
 *
 * becomes:
 *
 *   LockTimer<std::lock_guard<std::mutex>> lh(mutex, "my_func_lockholder")
 *
