 * just store data in simple containers for inspection whilst the full stack can
 * use a handler which frames and sends data to the client.
 *
 * For scans that are configured as Key only handleKey is invoked
 * For scans that are configured as Key/Value handleItem is invoked
 *
 * A single scan will never call a mixture of the functions
