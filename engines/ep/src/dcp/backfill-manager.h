/**
 * The BackfillManager is responsible for multiple DCP backfill
 * operations owned by a single DCP connection.
 * It consists of two main classes:
 *
 * - BackfillManager, which acts as the main interface for adding new
 *    streams.
 * - BackfillManagerTask, which runs on a background AUXIO thread and
 *    performs most of the actual backfilling operations.
 *
 * One main purpose of the BackfillManager is to impose a limit on the
 * in-memory buffer space a streams' backfills consume - often
 * ep-engine can read data from disk faster than the client connection
 * can consume it, and so without any limits we could exhaust the
 * bucket quota and cause Items to be evicted from the HashTable,
 * which is Bad. At a high level, these limits are based on giving
 * each DCP connection a maximum amount of buffer space, and pausing
 * backfills if the buffer limit is reached. When the buffers are
 * sufficiently drained (by sending to the client), backfilling can be
 * resumed.
 *
 * Significant configuration parameters affecting backfill:
 * - dcp_scan_byte_limit
 * - dcp_scan_item_limit
 * - dcp_backfill_byte_limit
 *
 * Implementation
 * --------------
 *
 * The BackfillManager owns a number of Backfill objects which are advanced by
 * an asynchronous (background) BackfillManagerTask. The BackfillManagerTask
 * is repeatedly scheduled as long as there is at least one Backfill ready to
 * run.
 *
 * The different Backfill objects reside in a series of queues, which are
 * used to (a) limit the number of Backfills in progress at any one time
 * (b) apply suitable scheduling to the active Backfills.
 *
 * The following queues exist:
 *
 * - initializing - Newly-scheduled Backfills are initially placed here. These
 *                  Backfills will be run first before any others.
 * - pending - Newly-scheduled Backfills are initially placed here if too many
 *             Backfills are already scheduled.
 * - active - Backfills which are actively being run. These backfills are run
 *            in queue order as long as no backfills exist in
 *            initializingBackfills. The order these are executed in depends on
 *            scheduleOrder.
 * - snoozing - Backfills which are not ready to run at present. They will be
 *              periodically be re-considered for running (and moving to
 *              activeBackfills)
 *
 * The lifecycle of a Backfill is:
 *
 *          schedule()
 *               |
 *               V
 *     exceeded active limit?
 *       /                \
