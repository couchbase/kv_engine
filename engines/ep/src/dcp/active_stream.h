/**
 * This class represents an "active" Stream of DCP messages for a given vBucket.
 *
 * "Active" refers to the fact this Stream is generating DCP messages to be sent
 * out to a DCP client which is listening for them.
 *
 * An ActiveStream is essentially a mini state-machine, which starts in
 * StreamState::Pending and then progresses through a sequence of states
 * based on the arguments passed to the stream and the state of the associated
 * VBucket.
 *
 * The expected possible state transitions are described below.
 * Note that error paths, where any state can transition directly to Dead are
 * omitted for brevity (and to avoid cluttering the diagram).
