/**
 * A simplistic implementation of a histogram backed by an array.
 *
 * This template is only suitable for "small" @p ArraySize values
 * as it requires an array of `CountType` sized to have an element for every
 * value [0, ArraySize).
 *
 * E.g.,
 *     ArrayHistogram<uint64_t, 256>
 *
 * will also instantiate an array of uint64_t, with size 256.
 *
 * This would not be viable with significantly larger ArraySize.
 *
 * By default the tracked values are cb::RelaxedAtomic<CountType>, and all
 * methods can be safely used from multiple threads.
 *
 * No locks are used; percentiles computed while the histogram is concurrently
 * modified will be approximate.
 *
 * If external synchronisation is provided or access is single threaded,
 * StoredType can be specified as a non-atomic type.
 *
 * @tparam CountType frequency type, type of the elements of the contained array
 * @tparam ArraySize number of bins the histogram should contain.
 * @tparam StoredType type used internally to store the frequency
