/**
 * Provides thread-safe counter functionality so as the counter increases it
 * becomes increasingly more difficult to increment.  This enables a high
 * granularity counter to be implemented using only a small number of bits.
 *
 * It is based on the logarithmic counter described at
 * http://antirez.com/news/109
 *
 * uint8_t LFULogIncr(uint8_t counter) {
 *     if (counter == 255) return 255;
 *     double r = (double)rand()/RAND_MAX;
 *     double baseval = counter - LFU_INIT_VAL;
 *     if (baseval < 0) baseval = 0;
 *     double p = 1.0/(baseval*server.lfu_log_factor+1);
 *     if (r < p) counter++;
 *     return counter;
 * }
 *
 * The actual counter is not held within the class as it is typically the bits
 * stored in a taggedPtr.
 *
 * Through experimentation it has been determined that you need a incFactor of:
 * - approx 800 to mimic a u32int counter (max value of 4,294,967,295)
 * - approx 0.012 to mimic a u16int counter (max value of 65,535)
 *
 * For example to replace a u16int counter with a probabilistic counter that
 * only requires 8-bits of storage, you would need to construct a
 * ProbabilisticCounter as follows:
 * ProbabilisticCounter<uint8_t> probabilisticCounter(2.0);
 *
 * It would be used as follows:
 *
 * uint8_t counter{0};
 * counter = probabilisticCounter.generateValue(counter);
 *
 * The generateValue can be called approximately 65,000 times before the counter
 * becomes saturated at 255.
