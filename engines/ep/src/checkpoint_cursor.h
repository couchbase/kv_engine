/**
 * A checkpoint cursor, representing the current position in a Checkpoint
 * series.
 *
 * CheckpointCursors are similar to STL-style iterators but for Checkpoints.
 * A consumer (DCP or persistence) will have one CheckpointCursor, initially
 * positioned at the first item they want. As they read items from the
 * Checkpoint the Cursor is advanced, allowing them to continue from where
 * they left off when they next attempt to read items.
 *
 * A CheckpointCursor has two main pieces of state:
 *
 * - currentCheckpoint - The current Checkpoint the cursor is operating on.
 * - currentPos - the position with the current Checkpoint.
 *
 * When a CheckpointCursor reaches the end of Checkpoint, the CheckpointManager
 * will move it to the next Checkpoint.
