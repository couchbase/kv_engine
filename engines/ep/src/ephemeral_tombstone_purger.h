/**
 * Ephemeral Bucket Tombstone Purger tasks
 *
 * Ephemeral buckets need to store tombstones (records of deleted documents) in
 * memory (unlike EP buckets which can store on disk). Such tombstones have a
 * finite lifetime, so we don't end up filling up all of RAM with them.
 * To handle this, there are a set of background tasks which run
 * periodically to purge tombstones which have reached a certain age.
 *
 * The high level process is simple - identify tombstones which are older than
 * ephemeral_metadata_purge_age, and remove them from memory. However,
 * the implementation is a little more complicated, due to the interaction
 * between the HashTable and SequenceList which are used to access
 * OrderedStoredValues:
 *
 * To purge OSVs we must remove them from both data-structures. For a HashTable
 * alone this would be straightforward - iterate across it identifying
 * tombstones we wish to purge, and remove from the HashTable (under the HTLock
 * for that particular item).
 * The SequenceList complicates things - the SeqList is non-owning (it only
 * holds ptrs to OSVs), and a range read may be in progress by
 * another actor. As such, we cannot actually delete (from HashTable) items
 * which are within an in-flight range read, as that would break DCP
 * invariants (if we've already told a downstream client that we have items in
 * range [A,Z], we cannot delete item M before it has been read).
 *
 * Therefore, purging is handled with a two-phase approach, with each phase
 * done by a different Task:
 *
 * 1. EphTombstoneHTCleaner - visit the HashTable for deleted items exceeding
 *    ephemeral_metadata_purge_age. For such items, unlink from the HashTable
 *    (but don't delete the object), and mark the item as stale.
 *    Such item can no longer be located via the HashTable, but are still in
 *    the SequenceList, hence in-progress range reads are safe to continue.
 *
 * 2. EphTombstoneStaleItemDeleter - iterate the SequenceList in order
 *    looking for stale OSVs. For such items unlink from the SequenceList and
 *    delete the OSV.
 *
 * Note that items can also become stale if they have been replaced with a newer
 * revision - this occurs when an item needs to be modified but the existing
 * revision is being read by a rangeRead and hence we cannot simply update the
 * existing item. As such, EphTombstoneStaleItemDeleter task deletes stale
 * items created in both situations, and isn't strictly limited to purging
 * tombstones.
