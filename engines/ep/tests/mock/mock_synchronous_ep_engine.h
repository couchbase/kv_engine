 * EPStore (in the initialize() method).

 * The net result is a (mostly) synchronous environment - while the
 * ExecutorPool's threads exist, none of the normally-created background Tasks
 * should be running. Note however that /if/ any new tasks are created, they
 * will be scheduled on the ExecutorPools' threads asynchronously.
