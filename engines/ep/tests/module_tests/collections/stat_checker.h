/**
 * RAII helper to check the per-collection stats changes in the expected
 * manner.
 *
 * Currently used through MemChecker (checking mem_used) and DiskChecker
 * (checking disk_size).
 *
 * Checks that the stat when the helper is destroyed vs when it was
 * created meets the given invariant. E.g.,
 *  {
 *      auto x = MemChecker(*vb, CollectionEntry::defaultC, std::greater<>());
 *      // do something which should change the mem used of the default
 *      // collection as tracked by the hash table statistics.
 *  }
 *
 * This checks that when `x` goes out of scope, the memory usage of the default
 * collection is _greater_ than when the checker was constructed.
