 * An opaque reference to a lock holder. This could be any of:
 * - folly::SharedMutex::ReadHolder
 * - folly::SharedMutex::WriteHolder
 * - std::lock_guard<std::mutex>
 * - std::unique_lock<std::mutex>
 *
 * The intention is to provide the same level of assurance that a lock is held
 * as that achieved by passing the lock holder by const& into functions. The
 * user of this struct needs to make sure that the proper locks are used and
 * that the lock used to initialize this object outlives this tag.
 *
 * Caveat: Cannot unlock(), upgrade/downgrade the locks. This type has the
 * semantics of a _const_ reference.
 *
 * The type argument is an optional "tag" type which can be used to distinguish
 * between `SharedLockRef` instances at the type-level.
 * (e.g. SharedLockRef<StateATag>, SharedLockRef<StateBTag>)
