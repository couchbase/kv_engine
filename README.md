# KV-Engine

Welcome to the Couchbase _KV-Engine_ project.

This started as Couchbase's fork of the upstream `memcached` project,
but has substantially evolved since then. It contains the bulk of the
code for the Key/Value service of Couchbase Server.

## Repository Layout

Areas of interest in the repository:

* [`include/`](include/) - Public header files.
* `daemon/` - Source for the main daemon process (also known as the
  _server_). This is where [`main()`](daemon/memcached.cc) lives.
* `engines/` - Source for the different engines (aka bucket types)
  supported. Includes:
    * [`ep`](engines/ep/) - _Eventually Persistent_ Engine. Powers the
    _Couchbase_ and _Ephemeral_ bucket types.
    * [`ewouldblock engine`](engines/ewouldblock_engine) - Test engine
      which interposes a real engine and can perform various types of
      error-injection.
* `tests/` - Test cases.
* `licenses/` - The various licenses in use

## Building

KV-Engine has a number of external dependancies, as such it should be
built via the Couchbase
[top-level Makefile](https://github.com/couchbase/tlm).
