* Details

** Ages

The difference between =ep_storage_age= and =ep_data_age= is somewhat
subtle, but when you consider that a given record may be updated
multiple times before hitting persistence, it starts to be clearer.

=ep_data_age= is how old the data we actually wrote is.

=ep_storage_age= is how long the object has been waiting to be
persisted.

** Too Young

=ep_too_young= is incremented every time an object is encountered
whose =data age= is more recent than is allowable for the persistence
layer.

For example, if an object that was queued five minutes ago is picked
off the =todo= queue and found to have been updated fifteen seconds
ago, it will not be stored, =ep_too_young= will be incremented, and
the key will go back on the input queue.

** Too Old

=ep_too_old= is incremented every time an object is encountered whose
=queue age= exceeds the =ep_queue_age_cap= setting.

=ep_queue_age_cap= generally exists as a safety net to prevent the
=ep_min_data_age= setting from preventing persistence altogether.

** Warming Up

Opening the data store is broken into three distinct phases:

*** Initializing

During the initialization phase, the server is not accepting
connections or otherwise functional.  This is often quick, but in a
server crash can take some time to perform recovery of the underlying
storage.

This time is made available via the =ep_dbinit= stat.

*** Warming Up

After initialization, warmup begins.  At this point, the server is
capable of taking new writes and responding to reads.  However, only
records that have been pulled out of the storage or have been updated
from other clients will be available for request.

(note that records read from persistence will not overwrite new
records captured from the network)

During this phase, =ep_warmup_thread= will report =running= and
=ep_warmed_up= will be increasing as records are being read.

*** Complete

Once complete, =ep_warmed_up= will stop increasing and
=ep_warmup_thread= will report =complete=.
