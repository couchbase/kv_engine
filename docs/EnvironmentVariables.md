# Environment variables

The memcached project use environment variables to tune the behaviour
of the system (both for test programs and in production).

This document tries to list all the environment variables in use, and what
they're used for.

## `BADMALLOC_FAILURE_RATIO`
This is a floating point and may be used to configure how often
`malloc()` / `realloc()` should return NULL.

This setting is only used if the `BadMalloc` allocator hook is enabled.

## `BADMALLOC_GRACE_PERIOD`

This is an unsigned integer used to allow the first N calls to
`malloc()` / `realloc()` to succeed.

This setting is only used if the `BadMalloc` allocator hook is enabled.

## `BADMALLOC_SEED`

This is an unsigned integer used to specify a fixed seed for the
random number generator which controls when to fail.

This setting is only used if the `BadMalloc` allocator hook is enabled.

## `CBSASL_PWFILE`

`CBSASL_PWFILE` is used to tell `cbsasl` the location of the password
database in JSON format.

## `CONFIG_TEST_MOCK_MALLOC_FAILURE`

This variable is used by a unit test to have the config library
simulate a memory allocation failure.

## `CONFIG_TEST_MOCK_SPOOL_FAILURE`

This variable is used by a unit test to have the config library
simulate a failure reading stuff from disk.

## `COUCHBASE_PACKET_DUMP`

Some of the command line tools will generate a packet dump if this
variable is set.

## `COUCHBASE_SSL_CIPHER_LIST`

Specify the list of ciphers allowed.

## `MEMCACHED_CRASH_TEST`

Variable set to identify that we're running the crash test (and allows)
loading of the crash engine.

## `MEMCACHED_NUM_CPUS`

The number of CPU's to use for frontend threads.

## `MEMCACHED_NUMA_MEM_POLICY`

The NUMA memory to use.

## `MEMCACHED_UNIT_TESTS`

Set to indicate that we're running unit tests

## `RUN_UNDER_VALGRIND`

Set to indicate that we're running under valgrind

## `T_MEMD_INITIAL_MALLOC`

Used to fake a memory allocation in "default_bucket" (should not be used)

## `T_MEMD_SLABS_ALLOC`

Used to tell "default_bucket" to preallocate memory (should not be used)

## `TESTAPP_ATTEMPTS`

May be used to tell `engine_testapp` to retry failed tests.

## `TESTAPP_ENABLE_COLOR`

May be set to let `engine_testapp` use colors in its output.

## `CB_MAXIMIZE_LOGGER_CYCLE_SIZE`

If set the logger will use 1GB file sizes

## `TESTAPP_PACKET_DUMP`

By setting this variable testapp dumps data sent/received in the old-style
tests in the following format:

    PLAIN> 0x80, 0xfd, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0c, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, ...
    PLAIN< 0x81, 0xfd, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, ...
