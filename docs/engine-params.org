* Configuring the Engine

Engine parameters may be specified using the =-e= option to
memcached.  These parameters control various aspects of the behavior
of the engine.

For example, if you would like to store your database in =/data/base=
and prevent it from having objects larger than 1MB, you would run
memcached like this:

: memcached -E ep.so -e 'dbfile=/data/base;max_item_size=1048576'
