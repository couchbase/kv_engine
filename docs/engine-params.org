* Configuring the Engine

Engine parameters may be specified using the =-e= option to
memcached.  These parameters control various aspects of the behavior
of the engine.

For example, if you would like to store your database in =/data/base=
and prevent it from having objects larger than 1MB, you would run
memcached like this:

: memcached -E ep.so -e 'dbfile=/data/base;max_item_size=1048576'

** Shard Patterns

When using a multi-sharded database, =shardpattern= specifies how
shards are named relative to the main database.

=shardpattern= uses a printf-style string to expand the path with the
given variables:

- =%d= : The directory name containing the main database
  (This will be =.= for relative paths).
- =%b= : The base name of the main database.
- =%i= : The shard number.

The default value of =shardpattern= is =%d/%b-%i.sqlite=
