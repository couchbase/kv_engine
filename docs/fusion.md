# 0x10 - Fusion Stats

This command is used to retrieve Fusion-related statistics from the server.
It is similar to a regular ```stat``` command but specifically targets
Fusion stats by using a specially formatted key.

The request has:
* A bucket
* No extras
* A key - must begin with the prefix "fusion"
* No value

## Key Format

```
fusion <stat-group> [<vbid>]
```
* ```<stat-group>```: The category of Fusion stats you want.

* ```<vbid>``` (optional): The specific VBucket ID to query.

## Stat Groups

The stat-group can be one of the following:
* ```active_guest_volumes```: Returns a JSON array of active Fusion volumes
for a VBucket.
* ```uploader```: Returns a JSON object of uploader progress related stats.
* ```migration```: Returns a JSON object of migration progress related stats.

## Behaviour

If a ```<vbid>``` is provided → Returns stats for that specific VBucket.

If a ```<vbid>``` is not provided → Returns aggregated stats across all
VBuckets.

If aggregation is not supported for the stat group, the request will fail.

## Returns

If the request is successful, the server will respond with a JSON object
where the keys are the stat names and the values are the corresponding
stat value.

Example response for `fusion active_guest_volumes`:
```
{
  "volume1",
  "volume2",
  "volume3"
}
```

Example response for `fusion uploader`:
```
{
  "vb_0": {
    "uploader_state": "enabled",
    "sync_session_completed_bytes": 100,
    "sync_session_total_bytes": 1000,
    "sync_snapshot_pending_bytes": 100
    "term": 2,
  },
  "vb_1": ...
}
```

Example response for `fusion migration 0`:
```
{
  "completed_bytes": 100,
  "total_bytes": 1000,
}
```


# 0x70 - Get Fusion Storage Snapshot
